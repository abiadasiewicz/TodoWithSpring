# TodoWithSpring
This is the same project what Todo, but working on Spring

Project of TODO list that helped me to learn how to make an application using Servlet.

What I have learned:

The first thing was Maven. I learned how to configure Maven, add dependecies, plugins and genrally how it works.

The second was Servlet. I made a simple website using Jetty, on a localhost:8080 and made a response depending on the request. Initially webside showed an inscription "Hello" + parameter "name"

Next thing was unit testes by using JUnit. I made some tests that checks if Service class runs perfectly

Then I add h2 database and made a few SQLs with languages library and connect them with my project using Hibernate. And it really works! I was struggling with it for several days but finally I understood how it works :)

Afterwards the time has come for the front-end. I wasn't easy but by using templates from Pure CSS, somehow it looks and works. 

UPDATE:
I rebuilt whole project and base it on Spring/Spring Boot. I have learned how Spring injections dependencies, what does annotations do, and how important it is to work perfectly :)

How to run:

1) Run the project.
2) In your favorite browser go to page "localhost:8080"
3) Write your name and choose language
4) You can add new TODO! :)
